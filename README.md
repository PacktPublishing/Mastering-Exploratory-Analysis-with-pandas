This book covers the following exciting features:

* Learn how to read different kinds of data into pandas DataFrames for data analysis
* Manipulate, transform, and apply formulas to data imported into pandas DataFrames
* Use pandas to analyze and visualize different kinds of data to gain real-world insights
* Extract transformed data form pandas DataFrames and convert it into the formats your application expects
* Manipulate model time-series data, perform algorithmic trading, derive results on fixed and moving windows, and more
